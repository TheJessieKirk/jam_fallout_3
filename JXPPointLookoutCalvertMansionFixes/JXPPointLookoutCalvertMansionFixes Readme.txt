                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes License.txt” file to
       ensure you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes - Texture.bsa” and
       “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes
       Readme.txt” and “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes License.txt” to your
       PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes.esp”
       to enable it, then click/tap
       the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Fixes all the containers, strips ownership from the beds, fixes wine bottle
    placement, replaces many bottles with empty wine bottles and makes an
    accessible water leak radioactive in Calvert Mansion.

    Containers that are normally accessible by the player are now interactive
    (and containers that aren't are no longer interative).

    Beds in the mansion no longer belong to Desmond, so the player can use
    them.

    Beds and furniture that the player can't get to are no longer interactive,
    which might help load times.

    Wine bottles in the wine cellar are now placed better to minimise weird
    Havok Engine physics issues.

    Empty bottles in the wine cellar are now empty wine bottles instead.

    The leaky pipe the player can get near is now slightly radioactive, as is
    the norm for water in Point Lookout.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Containers that are inexplicably inaccessible make no sense; a container
    that's fallen over, blocking the drawers/doors etc, buried in rubble, etc.
    is fine, but just sitting there normally is just silly.

    Normally interactive objects that the player can't access are just a waste
    of computer memory.

    Demond owned every bed in Calvert Mansion except the makeshift bedding that
    he kept in his command post.

    Empty Scotch bottles were probably used in the wine cellar because there
    aren't actually any empty wine bottles in the game.

    Non-radioactive water leaks are very rare in the Wasteland; radioactive
    leaky pipes are the norm, such as in the Mirelurk Nesting Hole. The water
    in Point Lookout is just as bad.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes - Meshes.bsa”
       “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes - Textures.bsa” and
       “JXPPointLookoutCalvertMansionFixes.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    3. Optionally, extract the files
       “JXPMusicFixes Readme.txt” and “JXPMusicFixes License.txt” to your PC's
       Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPMusicFixes.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod changes the Rangers Compound music from the dungeon playlist (that
    plays in metros, caves and such) to the base playlist (that plays in The
    Citadel, The Mall, etc.), and adds the dungeon playlist to the Talon
    Company Camp (which was previously silent).

    NOTE: This mod used to be called the Jessie's Reilly's Rangers Compound
    Music Mod.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    It seems a bit strange to play spooky dungeon music in a friendly base like
    the Reilly's Ranger Compound, and adding the aforementioned music to the
    Talon Company Camp greatly adds to the intimidating feel of the place.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPMusicFixes.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

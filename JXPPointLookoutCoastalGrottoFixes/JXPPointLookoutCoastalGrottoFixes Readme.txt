       PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Stops Plik from running up and down the cave, adds a camera, fixes
    ownership issues, makes the Grotto accessible from the shoreline with a
    catwalk and fixes a container.

    Plik will now just sit in his chair rather than run up and down the cave.

    A security camera is now mounted in Plik's Safari.

    Plik now owns his belongings, thus taking them is stealing from him. The
    player can still read his journal, however.

    The Coastal Grotto entrance is now reachable from the shoreline via a
    catwalk.

    A non-interactive desk is now interactive.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Plik seems to prefer running up and down the cave more than sitting in his
    chair; this didn't prevent the player from starting Plik's Safari, but it
    was time-wasting and weird.

    Plik has evidently spent time rigging up a TV set judging by the wire loom
    behind it, but there's no TV broadcasts in Point Lookout. It makes sense to
    add a CCTV feed from the Safari so he can watch the action, as well as know
    when said action is over.

    Plik didn't actually own his belongings in the cave so didn't care if you
    robbed him. This seems like an oversite.

    Previously, it was only possible to reach the Coastal Grotto by either
    carefully dropping down from the cliff above, or awkwardly jumping up the
    cliff from the shoreline. That's hardly good business. A catwalk from the
    shoreline works as the Grotto's entrance is some kind of pre-War utility
    doorway.

    Containers that are inexplicably inaccessible make no sense; a container
    that's fallen over, blocking the drawers/doors etc, buried in rubble, etc.
    is fine, but just sitting there normally is just silly.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutCoastalGrottoFixes.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

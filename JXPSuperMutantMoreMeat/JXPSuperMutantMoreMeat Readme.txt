                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPSuperMutantMoreMeat License.txt” file to ensure you
       understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPSuperMutantMoreMeat.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPSuperMutantMoreMeat.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The
       usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPSuperMutantMoreMeat Readme.txt” and
       “JXPSuperMutantMoreMeat License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPSuperMutantMoreMeat.esp” to enable
       it, then click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds Human Flesh, Brahim Steak, Mirelurk Meat and Yao Guai Meat to
    the possible random items Super Mutants carry, although it's more likely
    they will carry more common meat (with Human Flesh somewhere in the middle,
    odds-wise).

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Super Mutants aren't picky; it's established they eat humans, hunt Brahmin
    and shoot/smash pretty much any animal.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPSuperMutantMoreMeat.esp”. The mod is now
    uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added more meat items via script injection to the levelled meat list
      used exclusively by Super Mutants.

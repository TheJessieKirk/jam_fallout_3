                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXP44Magnum License.txt” file to ensure you understand your
       rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXP44Magnum.bsa” and “JXP44Magnum.esp” from the
       archive file “JXP44Magnum.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory.
       The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXP44Magnum Readme.txt” and
       “JXP44Magnum License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to
       retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXP44Magnum.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds the .44 Magnum (without scope) to the game. Previously, only
    the Mysterious Stranger had one, and Paulson a modified one in Mothership
    Zeta.

    Containers and NPCs that spawn with a random Scoped .44 Magnum have an
    equal chance of having a regular .44 Magnum instead.

    The .44 Magnum doesn't appear anywhere in the world; it will only appear as
    a random item.

    It can be repaired, and be used to repair, Blackhawk and Scoped .44
    Magnums.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The regular .44 Magnum appears in Fallout 2 (as the .44 Magnum revolver),
    Fallout Tactics (as the 44 M29 revolver), Fallout New Vegas (as the .44
    Magnum revolver), and Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 (as the .44 pistol) as an
    ordinary, obtainable weapon, but only appears in Fallout 3 in the hands of
    the Mysterious Stranger, and Paulson in Mothership Zeta.

    Since it's perfectly lore-friendly it seems a suitable addition to the
    base game.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JWeapon44Magnum.bsa” and “JWeapon44Magnum.esp”. The
       mod is now uninstalled.

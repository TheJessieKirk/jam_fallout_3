                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXP44Magnum - License.txt” file to ensure you understand
       your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXP44Magnum.bsa” and “JXP44Magnum.esp” from
       the archive file “JXP44Magnum.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXP44Magnum - Readme.txt” and
       “JXP44Magnum - License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXP44Magnum.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds the .44 Magnum (without scope) to the game. Previously, only
    the Mysterious Stranger had one, and Paulson a modified one in Mothership
    Zeta.

    Containers and NPCs that spawn with a random Scoped .44 Magnum have an
    equal chance of having a regular .44 Magnum instead.

    The .44 Magnum doesn't appear anywhere in the world; it will only appear as
    a random item.

    It can be repaired, and be used to repair, Blackhawk and Scoped .44
    Magnums.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The regular .44 Magnum appeared in Fallout 2 (as the .44 Magnum revolver)
    and Fallout Tactics (as the 44 M29 revolver) and appears in Fallout New
    Vegas (as the .44 Magnum revolver), Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 (as the .44
    pistol) as an ordinary, obtainable weapon, but only appeared in Fallout 3
    in the hands of the Mysterious Stranger, and Paulson in Mothership Zeta.

    Since it's perfectly lore-friendly, and only required some new Pip-Boy
    icons to implement as a playable weapon, it seems a suitable addition to
    the base game.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JWeapon44Magnum.bsa” and “JWeapon44Magnum.esp”. The
       mod is now uninstalled.

    NOTE: Any .44 Magnums (without scope) you have in your player character's
          inventory, have placed in any containers or placed in the world will
          disappear if this mod is uninstalled. If you reinstall this mod in the
          future, they won't reappear.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPPointLookoutHomesteadMotelFixes License.txt” file to
       ensure you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPPointLookoutHomesteadMotelFixes.esp” from the
       archive file “JXPPointLookoutHomesteadMotelFixes.zip” to your PC's
       Fallout 3 Data directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPPointLookoutHomesteadMotelFixes
       Readme.txt” and “JXPPointLookoutHomesteadMotelFixes License.txt” to
       your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPPointLookoutHomesteadMotelFixes.esp”
       to enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Fixes containers in the Homestead Motel guest rooms.

    Non-interactive desks that are accessible to the player are now interactive.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Containers that are inexplicably inaccessible make no sense; a container
    that's fallen over, blocking the drawers/doors etc, buried in rubble, etc.
    is fine, but just sitting there normally is just silly.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutHomesteadMotelFixes.esp”. The mod is
       now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Replaced accessible static containers with actual containers.

    0.1.1

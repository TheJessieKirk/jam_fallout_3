       “JXPMarigoldStationFix.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The
       usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPMarigoldStationFix Readme.txt” and
       “JXPMarigoldStationFix License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPMarigoldStationFix.esp” to enable it,
       then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod kills any remaining fire ants below ground when the inhibitor
    pulse is activated during Those!, both in Marigold Station and the Queen
    Ant's Hatchery.

    It does not affect the fire ant queen; if the player didn't kill her,
    she'll still be alive.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Doc Lesko tells the player that the inhibitor pulse will drive any fire
    ants into a frenzy, destroying each other. Since this has the effect of
    simply killing any remaining fire ants on the surface, it should do the
    same thing to any of them below ground as well (we can assume the actual
    frenzied ant-on-ant burning action went on while the player was in the
    Queen Ant's Hatchery, like it does on the surface).

    It doesn't affect the fire ant queen because she wouldn't exactly have an
    empathic link with herself, would she?

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JJXPMarigoldStationFix.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added a script to check if Those! has triggered in master ant kill call,
      then kill all remaining subterranean fire ants via script injection, with
      a quest to call the script.
      Added references to all subterranean fire ants so the script can kill
      them.

                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the JXPMamaDolcesFixes License.txt” file to ensure you understand
       your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPMamaDolcesFixes.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPMamaDolcesFixes.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The
       usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPMamaDolcesFixes Readme.txt” and
       “JXPMamaDolcesFixes License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPMamaDolcesFixes.esp” to enable it,
       then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod fixes the locked, yet keyless, gate to nowhere in Mama Dolce's
    Loading Yard, and the switch inside that does nothing.

    The gate is now marked as inaccessible and had some metal plates welded to
    it to seal it.

    The switch now controls the door next to it; opening and closing it
    (although the door can still be opened and closed directly).

                                 4. RATIONALE

    A gate to disguise the fact there's nothing more to the factory courtyard
    is just fine, but setting it to require a key prompts the player to try to
    find one.

    The switch was presumably added to explain how the Chinese Remnant inside
    was able to open the door, or perhaps the door was originally going to be
    remote-access-only in development but was changed for the "ambush" script?
    In any case, a switch that does nothing is just silly.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPMamaDolcesFixes.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Made gate inaccessible and stuck some plates infront of it.
      Made a new electrical switch object with a script to control both opening
      and closing the door without interfering with the "ambush" script or an
      NPCs ability to activate it.

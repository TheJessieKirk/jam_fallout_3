                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPEssentialPride - License.txt” file to ensure you
       understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPEssentialPride.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPEssentialPride.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The usual
       locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPEssentialPride - Readme.txt” and
       “JXPEssentialPride - License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPEssentialPride.esp” to enable it,
       then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod makes all the members of Lyon's Pride essential (unkillable),
    except the late Jennings and DOA Reddin.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    In Broken Steel, Elder Lyons states that the Pride has been working to
    wipe out all remaining Enclave bastions. It's a bit hard to do that if a
    chunk of their squad got themselves killed.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPEssentialPride.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

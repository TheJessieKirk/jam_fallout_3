             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPCutContentClutter Readme.txt”
       and “JXPCutContentClutter Licenses.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPCutContentClutter.esp” to enable it,
       then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds a cut Brotherhood of Steel Outcasts banner, PreWar books and
    keys back into Fallout 3.

    Creates a new mesh and texture for the Outcast banner (which is in the code
    but uses a stand-in banner), and places it above the entrance to Fort
    Independence. Also adds a light that illuminates the banner at night.

    Adds the six cut PreWar books, which can be found fairly uncommonly in
    some loot containers and in the hands of junk merchants. All can be given
    to Scribe Yearling for caps and XP.

    Dukov's Place Key (formerly Dukov's House Key) has been added to Dukov
    himself, and the back door is now locked with it.

    Jericho now has his key (Housekey - Jericho).

    The safe at the concierge desk in The Stateman Hotel is now locked with the
    Stateman Safe Key, which can be found nearby in a cash register.

    The Roosevelt Hall Key (formerly Key to Main Hall) can now be found in the
    posession of the Super Mutant boss (the same one that has the Roosevelt
    Library Key), which now unlocks a new back door to the Roosevelt Arts and
    Athletics Hall.

    The Hospital Master Meds Key (formerly OLH Master Meds Key) can now be
    found on the Mr. Handy on the Our Lady of Hope Hospital first floor. It
    opens all the locked medical safes on the first and second floors.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Cut content is fun content, plus it's lore-friendly.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPCutContentClutter.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added objects for the missing books. Inserted them into various lists via
      script injection.
      Added keys to various NPCs via script injection. Had to give a REF name
      to the Super Mutant Boss and Mr. Handy in order to add them this way.
      Added a new nav-meshed back door to the Roosevelt Arts and Athletics
      Hall.
      Added the Stateman Safe Key to a new container, placed at the front desk.

    0.2.0
      Fixed activation issue with the new back door to the Roosevelt Academy.

    0.3.0
      Added cut Outcast Banner and script-controlled emergency light to
      illuminate it.

    0.3.1
      Outcast Banner now replaces the original banner rather than adding a new
      object.
      Made 100% compatible with the Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch.

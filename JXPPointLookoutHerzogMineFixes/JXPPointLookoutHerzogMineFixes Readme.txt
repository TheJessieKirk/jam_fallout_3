    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPPointLookoutHerzogMineFixes
       Readme.txt” and “JXPPointLookoutHerzogMineFixes License.txt” to your
       PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.

       enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Repositions a shelf full of goodies you can't interact with and makes an
    unreachable Abraxo Cleaner reachable.

    A shelf full of minor loot, and it's contents, have been moved forward so
    that the player can interact with the items.

    An Abraxo Cleaner was floating out of bounds beneath the cave floor; it's
    been moved upwards into Kenny's house.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The shelf was certainly meant to be interactive and looks like it should be
    accessible; the issue was the collision geometry of the house is a tad
    overzealous.

    The Abraxo Cleaner was lying quite flat, so I think it was supposed to be
    in Kenny's house rather than on the uneven cave floor.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutHerzogMineFixes.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Moved shelf unit and contents forward out of the house's collision mesh.
      Moved a floating Abraxo Cleaner upwards onto the floor of the house.

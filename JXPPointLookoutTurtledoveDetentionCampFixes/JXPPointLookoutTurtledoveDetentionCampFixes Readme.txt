                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPPointLookoutTurtledoveDetentionCampFixes License.txt”
       file to ensure you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPPointLookoutTurtledoveDetentionCampFixes.esp” from
       the archive file “JXPPointLookoutTurtledoveDetentionCampFixes.zip” to
       your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The usual locations of this
       directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files
       “JXPPointLookoutTurtledoveDetentionCampFixes Readme.txt” and
       “JXPPointLookoutTurtledoveDetentionCampFixes License.txt” to your PC's
       Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to
       “JXPPointLookoutTurtledoveDetentionCampFixes.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Fixes missing light beams, adds electrical arcs to the transformer and
    fixes floating object issues.

    The Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch causes some papers and a clipboard
    to float in the air in the Administration building. They are now back where
    they were. You don't need the Patch to use this mod, however.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Some of the floodlights only had one light beam emitting from them, despite
    the bulbs being intact.

    The transformer still being on really helps the environmental storytelling
    in the shack, as it makes it much easier to work out what happened in
    there.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutTurtledoveDetentionCampFixes.esp”. The
       mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added light beam FX to floodlights.
      Placed override on floating objects and added references to save them
      from an xEdit quick autoclean.
      Added two electrical arcs to the transformer.

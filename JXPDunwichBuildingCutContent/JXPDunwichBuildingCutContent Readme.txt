                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent Licenses.txt” file to ensure
       you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent - Textures.bsa” and
       “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent Readme.txt”
       and “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent Licenses.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3
       Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent.esp” to
       enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod properly restores the Bloody Sketch cut content to the Dunwich
    Building.

    While the Updated Unofficial Patch does this, the note used does not
    resemble the actual sketch and continues to use a temporary stand-in note.

    This mod is 100% compatible with the Updated Unofficial Patch if you use
    it.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    If you use the Updated Unofficial Patch, the note should resemble the
    actual sketch. If not... well, cut content is fun content, plus it's
    lore-friendly.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent - Textures.bsa” and
       “JXPDunwichBuildingCutContent.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

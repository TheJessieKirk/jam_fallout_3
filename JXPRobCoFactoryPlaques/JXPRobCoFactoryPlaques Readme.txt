       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod displays RobCo sales hype when the player activates the plaques in
    the lobby of the RobCo Factory Floor.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The plaques in the Museum of Technology display information when activated:
    why not the plaques in the RobCo Factory?

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPRobCoFactoryPlaques.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Replaced all plaques on the RobCo Factory Floor with activators, each
      with a script and message.

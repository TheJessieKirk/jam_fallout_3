                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes License.txt” file to
       ensure you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes.bsa” and
       “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory.
       The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes Readme.txt”
       and “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to
       “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Makes about half the soldiers in the simulation women, corrects loadout
    mistakes, the Strike Team wear open helmets, provides compatibility between
    Operation Anchorage and the Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch Goodies mod, and
    fixes numerous other things.

    CAVEAT: A lot of these are grey-area fixes and border on cut-content, but
    I still consider them essenial enough to be "fixes". Anything more
    blatantly cut should go in it's own mod, and all fixes will be
    re-evaluated at that time.

    About half of the American and Chinese soldiers will now be women.
    Consequently, all references to "Infantryman" have been changed to
    "Infantry".

    Equipment carried by Strike Team members now matches what Patterson's
    Terminal describes them as having.

    Patterson's Terminal entries and the Requisition Terminal entries have been
    corrected and normalised.

    American Snipers and Sniper Strike Team members now carry Silenced 10mm
    Pistols instead of regular ones.

    All non-interactive clutter items (pots and clipboards) changed to regular
    items by the Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch Goodies Mod are changed back to
    non-interactive. You do NOT need the Goodies Mod to use this mod, however.

    American Strike Team members wear open-faced Winterized Combat Helmets so
    their non-generic faces can be seen. The player and Sergeant Benjamin
    Montgomery also wear them for consistancy.

    NOTE: Chinese women soldiers are currently not voice-acted, but they will
    be in an update. They are currently silent.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    American women soldiers were *almost* completely voice acted, but were
    possibly dropped due to the complex soldier-generation system. I consider
    this a fix rather than cut content, as half of us are women IRL.

    Unlike the normal American soldiers, the Strike Team members have varied
    appearances based on ethnicity that you can't see. This required the
    developers to create a complex Strike Team generation system, so covering
    their faces was probably a mistake.

    There is an open-faced Winterized Combat Helmet in the game's code that is
    complete; they were probably the ones used by the Strike Team before the
    face-covered versions were made.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes.bsa” and
       “JXPOperationAnchorageFixes.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Created female versions of all regular American Soldier units and Strike
      Team units by duplicating the template system.
      Wrote a script to inject changes in, rather than mess with the scripts
      directly, for compatibility.
      Added overwrites to the Goodies mod to fix the interactive items it
      added, and made them named references to survive XEdit quick auto-cleans.
      Removed the possibility of female versions of certain American NPCs by
      reassigning their templates. Gameplay is unaffected by this.
      Updated the dialogue and Terminal entries to reflect changes.
      Added Silenced 10mm Pistol to American Sniper units.
      Finished the open-faced Winterized Combat Helmet and added it in.

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:

       PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPPointLookoutTrappersCabinFixes.esp”
       to enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Fixes the cellar trap and ownership issues.

    Occupants of the cellar trap, and the player, can no longer attack each
    other through the jail bars as long as the doors have never been opened.

    The jail doors now work correctly when operated via the electrical switch,
    and can now only be opened via the electrical switch.

    The Updated Unofficial Patch places ownership on the other traps so that
    the Swampfolk cannot trigger them. Ownership of indoor traps that are
    already tripped has been removed.

    You don't need the Updated Unofficial Patch to use this mod, however.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The occupants of the jails nicely make it difficult for the player to reach
    he safes, but it's not much of a trap if the player can just shoot them
    through the bars.

    The Updated Unofficial Patch assigning ownership to interior traps is
    unneccesary as they are already tripped.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutTrappersCabinFixes.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Overrides added to interior bear traps with reference names to survive an
      xEdit quick autoclean.
      Replaced electrical switch and added new script to disable jail collision
      meshes and control the doors.

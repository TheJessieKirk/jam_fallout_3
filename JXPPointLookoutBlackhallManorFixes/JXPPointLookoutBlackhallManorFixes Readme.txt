       Fallout 3 Data directory.
       The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPPointLookoutBlackhallManorFixes
       Readme.txt” and “JXPPointLookoutBlackhallManorFixes License.txt” to your
       PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.

       to enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Makes Obadiah Blackhall Very Evil, fixes a container, assigns ownership
    and removes an unreachable bottle in Blackhall Manor.

    Obadiah is now Very Evil, being into Lovecraftian nonesense and all.

    A non-interactive desk that is accessible to the player is now interactive.

    The Manor didn't belong to anyone, so you could rob Obadiah and he wouldn't
    care. Now it belongs to him.

    An empty Scotch bottle inside a wall has been removed.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Containers that are inexplicably inaccessible make no sense; a container
    that's fallen over, blocking the drawers/doors etc, buried in rubble, etc.
    is fine, but just sitting there normally is just silly.

    Obadiah Blackhall owns the mansion, so he should actually care if you try
    to rob him. He reacts if you attack him, so why not react to robbing him?

    An inaccessible misc. item is just a waste of computer memory.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutBlackhallManorFixes.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Replaced an accessible static container with an actual container.
      Assigned ownership of the Blackhall Manor interior cells to Obadiah
      Blackhall.
      Removed an inaccessible bottle.

    0.1.1
      Made Blackhall Manor a public area (but not the basement).
      Made the basement off-limits, so Obadiah will be cross if he catches you
      going in.
      Made Obadiah very evil.

    0.1.2
      Updated ESP description.
      Fixed documentation syntax.

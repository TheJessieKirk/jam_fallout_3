                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPReillysRangersCompoundMusic License.txt” file to ensure
       you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPReillysRangersCompoundMusic.esp” from the archive
       file “JXPReillysRangersCompoundMusic.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files
       “JXPReillysRangersCompoundMusic Readme.txt” and
       “JXPReillysRangersCompoundMusic License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3
       Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPReillysRangersCompoundMusic.esp” to
       enable it, then click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod changes the Rangers Compound music from the dungeon playlist (that
    plays in metros, caves and such) to the base playlist (that plays in The
    Citadel, The Mall, etc.)

                                 4. RATIONALE

    It seems a bit strange to play spooky dungeon music in a friendly base.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPReillysRangersCompoundMusic.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Changed Reilly's Rangers Compound music from dungeon to base.

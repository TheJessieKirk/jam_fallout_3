                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPClassicClutter License.txt” file to ensure you understand
       your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXPClassicClutter - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPClassicClutter - Textures.bsa” and “JXPClassicClutter.esm” from the
       archive file “JXPClassicClutter.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Also, if you have Broken Steel, extract the file
       “JXPClassicClutterBrokenSteelCP.esp” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory.

    4. Optionally, extract the files “JXPClassicClutter Readme.txt” and
       “JXPClassicClutter License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    5. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPClassicClutter.esm”, and/or
       “JXPClassicClutterThePittCP.esp” and
       “JXPClassicClutterBrokenSteelCP.esp” if you have them, to enable them,
       then click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds the Black and Red COA Badges from Fallout, and Yellow Pass
    Cards from Fallout and Fallout 2 to Fallout 3.

    Confessor Cromwell and Mother Maya carry the Black COA Badge, and regular
    Children of Atom carry the Red COA Badge.

    Critters that spawn with a random Blue or Red Pass Card have an equal
    chance of having a Yellow Pass Card.

    Like the Blue and Red Pass Cards, the Yellow Pass Card doesn't appear
    anywhere in the world and is useless; it will only appear as a random item.

    And if you use the Broken Steel Compatability Patch, the members of the
    Apostles of the Eternal Light will also carry AEL Badges (which are
    otherwise identical.)

    NOTE 1: If you upgrade from any previous version prior to 0.1.2, any Yellow
    Pass Cards you have in your inventories will disapear. You can add
    replacements to your inventory using the console:

        Player.AddItem 01000EA6 1

    NOTE 2: This mod used to be called Jessie's Missing Junk Mod.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The Black and Red COA (and AEL) Badges appeared in Fallout (as the “COC
    Badge”). Albeit the Church of the Cathedral and Church of Atom/Apostles of
    Eternal Light are different, but they all hold very similar beliefs, and it
    makes a nice callback.

    The Blue, Red and Yellow Pass Cards appeared in Fallout (as the Blue, Red
    and Yellow pass keys), and the Red and Yellow Pass in Fallout 2 (as the Red
    and Yellow reactor keycards). Since it's perfectly lore-friendly, and just
    as useless as the other keys, why not have the complete set?

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPClassicClutter - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPClassicClutter - Textures.bsa” and “JXPClassicClutter.esm”. Also,
       delete “JXPClassicClutterBrokenSteelCP.esp” if you have it. The mod is
       now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

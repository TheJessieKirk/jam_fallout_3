       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Gives the submarine a more correct Chinese designation, switches image
    space to a more naval one and removes sound effects from flooded
    generators.

    The submarine's designation “SSN-37-1A” has been renamed to “Changcheng
    371”.

    The image space used inside the submarine has been changed to match Rivet
    City for that navy look and feel.

    Two portable diesel generators that are flooded no longer make a noise.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The submarine had the designation “SSN-37-1A”; this is a NATO
    hull designation system called STANAG 1166.

    China has never used this system; the submarine has been renamed
    “Changcheng 371”. The Changcheng designation was used for Chinese
    submarines throughout the 1960s, which is when China first acquired modern
    submarines from the USSR.

    The submarine's image space now matches Rivet City. It uses Rivet City
    assets for the interior anyway.

    A diesal generator onboard the submarine that is flooded out, and a second
    generator on the seabed near the submarine, are unlikely to still be
    chugging away, even in the Fallout universe.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutSubmarineFixes.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPFortConstantineCC Licenses.txt” file to ensure you
       understand your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXPFortConstantineCC - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPFortConstantineCC - Sounds.bsa”,
       “JXPFortConstantineCC - Textures.bsa” and
       “JXPFortConstantineCC.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPFortConstantineCC.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The
       usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPFortConstantineCC Readme.txt” and
       “JXPFortConstantineCC Licenses.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPFortConstantineCC.esp” to enable it,
       then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Adds a new Ghoulish area to Fort Constantine with cut content, mummifies
    Tara Field's corpse and makes doors auto-lock to explain why the keys are
    still needed.

    The keys and doors are re-organised, and the new area houses Crowley's cut
    content terminal entries, and reveals more of his backstory.

    NOTE: This mod used to be called Fort Constantine Tara Fields Corpse Mod.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    It's explained during You Gotta Shoot 'Em In The Head that the mercenary
    team had difficulty with Ghouls, yet there are no Ghouls at the fort. While
    adding a Ghoulish area, I couldn't resist adding Crowley's cut content,
    with a suitable explanation as to why he was trapped there for so long.

    Tara Fields' corpse wouldn't look fresh after so many years; instead it
    should be mummified by the dry, critter-free environment.

    Also, the keys are apparently still required, seeing as returning to the
    Fort without all of them isn't an option for Crowley. It seems unlikely
    that the mercenary team would have locked all the doors behing them, so now
    the doors electronically shut by themselves.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPFortConstantineCC - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPFortConstantineCC - Sounds.bsa”,
       “JXPFortConstantineCC - Textures.bsa” and
       “JXPFortConstantineCC.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Removed Tara Field's body and replaced with a skeleton and small Metal
      Box containing her ammunition and key.
      Repositioned Tara Field's 10mm pistol and stimpack.

    0.2.0
      Added new Ghoulish area to Fort Constantine.
      Set doors locked with special keys to automatically close and buzz open.
      Changed Warhead Storage Key to Tara's Special Key.
      Changed Fort Constantine Bunker Door to CO Quarters Door.

    0.2.1
      Made 100% compatible with the Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch.
      Doors now make the correct opening/closing sounds.
      Fixed editor names.
      Changed the triggers to be one trigger with one script.
      Fixed the CO Quarters door not relocking.
      Fixed the Waste Disposal gate not relocking and not buzzing open.
      Reorganised doors.
      Made the dead Ghoul and robots persistant references so they're corpses
      stay looted.
      Adjusted Waste Disposal lighting to reflect other areas of the base.
      Made Crowley's Special Key dirty rather than clean.
      Made Tara's Special Key worth 20 caps like the other special keys.
      Adjusted Tara's body so she's not blocking the door as much.
      Adjusted Tara's pistol to better reflect where her body is and so it's
      not floating slightly.
      Fixed Tara's script so it's not dependent on a global variable.
      Added a dust effect around Tara's body.
      Fixed Tara's body being an obstacle and adjusted area navmesh to go
      around her.
      Added some acoustic spaces to Waste Disposal.
      Added emittance to lights and effects in Waste Disposal.
      Added collision markers to make it a little harder for followers to
      murder the Ghouls from above in Waste Disposal.
      Removed quest-controlled background scripts and handed control to local
      controllers, as less quests running in the background is more efficient.
      Improved Waste Disposal door script to use a disable/enable switcher instead of
      lots of persistant references.
      Changed faulty door lock terminal message to one more serious.
      Removed door initial state checker. It was causing too many problems.

    3. Additionally, if you have Point Lookout, extract the file
       “JXPDumpstersPointLookoutCP.esp” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory.

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPDumpsters Readme.txt” and
       “JXPDumpsters License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to
       retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPDumpsters.esp” and/or
       “JXPDumpstersPointLookoutCP.esp” to enable it/them, then click/tap the
       “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Changes the name of all Trash Bins to Dumpsters.

    So next time you go dumpster diving for fun (and profit), you don't have to
    say you're going trash bin diving for fun (and profit) and have everyone
    awkwardly stare at you then prod you with sharp objects.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    I'm a massive pedant.

    Dumpster was a trademark of Dempster Brothers, but the name was used for
    the first commercially successful garbage trucks in the US and it stuck,
    making it a generic trademark.

    Bethesda even called it a dumpster in the code, but probably didn't want to
    risk getting in legal trouble. However, the trademarks of the name have
    long expired.

    Anyway, I'm told it's what Americans call wheelie bins and skips.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file(s) “JXPDumpsters.esp”, and
       “JXPDumpstersPointLookoutCP.esp” if you have it. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Renamed Trash Bins to Dumpsters.

                                  7. CREDITS

    Thanks to the nice Americans on my socials that confirmed to me the photo
    of the wheelie bin I posted was called a dumpster.

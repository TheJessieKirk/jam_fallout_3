    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPPointLookoutEssentialPanada
       Readme.txt” and “JXPPointLookoutEssentialPanada License.txt” to your
       PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.

       to enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Makes Panada essential (unkillable).

                                 4. RATIONALE

    She'd have seen it coming?

    I have no rationale. I'm a big squish and don't want Panada to die.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutEssentialPanada.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Made Panada essential via script injection.

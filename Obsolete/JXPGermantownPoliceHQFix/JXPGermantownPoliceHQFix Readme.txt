                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPGermantownPoliceHQFix License.txt” file to ensure you
       understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPGermantownPoliceHQFix.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPGermantownPoliceHQFix.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory.
       The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPGermantownPoliceHQFix Readme.txt”
       and “JXPGermantownPoliceHQFix License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPGermantownPoliceHQFix.esp” to
       enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    NOTE: This mod is OBSOLETE: it was either added to the Updated Unofficial
    Fallout 3 Patch [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19122] or they
    came up with the same idea. If I find anything else in the Germantown
    Police HQ that needs fixing, I'll create a new mod.

    This mod makes the Germantown Jailer's Key unlock all three locked cell
    doors, rather than just Red's cell.

    NOTE: This mod used to be called Jessie's Germantown Jailer's Key Mod.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The Jailer's key should really unlock all of the cells in the Jail;
    otherwise, it should be labelled an individual cell key.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPGermantownPoliceHQFix.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

       “JXPRivetCityBrokenBowFix.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory.
       The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPRivetCityBrokenBowFix Readme.txt”
       and “JXPRivetCityBrokenBowFix License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3
       Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPRivetCityBrokenBowFix.esp” to
       enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Fixes issues with the bridge leading to Rivet City's Broken Bow.

    Specifically, the player must either jump, or perch awkwardly on the rocky
    shore and move carefully, to get on the bridge leading to the Broken Bow.

    This mod allows the player to just walk onto the bridge.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    It's counter-inuitive to expect the player to know to jump onto the bridge.
    There's plenty of rickity structures in Fallout 3 that simply allow the
    player to walk onto them.

    I think it was just an oversite by the developers.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPRivetCityBrokenBowFix.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added am angled collision marker infront of the bridge that acts as a
      ramp.

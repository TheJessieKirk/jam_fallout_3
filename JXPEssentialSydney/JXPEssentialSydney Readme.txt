                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPEssentialSydney License.txt” file to ensure you
       understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPEssentialSydney.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPEssentialSydney.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The
       usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPEssentialSydney Readme.txt” and
       “JXPEssentialSydney License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPEssentialSydney.esp” to enable it,
       then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Makes Sydney essential (unkillable), with a caveat:

    There's a very rare situation we must account for:

    * The player has Sydney as a follower during Stealing Independence,
    * The player then takes her into the Jefferson Memorial Rotunda *before*
      the scene in which Dad dies during The Waters of Life,
    * The player then tells her to wait in the Rotunda beyond the airlock and
      leaves her there,
    * The player then *returns* to the Rotunda to experience the aforementioned
      scene: Sydney will be standing there with Dad and the others:

    The game accounts for this; any followers left in the area beyond the
    airlock are killed by the radiation burst along with everyone else.

    Sydney loses her essential state if this rare situation occurs, and is
    killed along with everyone else.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    I have no rationale. I'm a big squish and don't want Sydney to die.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPEssentialSydney.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

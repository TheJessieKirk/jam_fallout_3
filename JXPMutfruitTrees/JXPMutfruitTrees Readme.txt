    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPMutfruitTrees Readme.txt” and
       “JXPMutfruitTrees License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to
       retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPMutfruitTrees.esp” to enable
       it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds mutfruit trees to various Wasteland settlements.

    Trees can be found in Big Town, Canterbury Commons, Grayditch, Gurdershade,
    Megaton and The Republic of Dave.

    The remains of a tree can be found in Arefu.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Mutfruit trees appear in Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, but only mutfruit itself
    appears in Fallout and Fallout 2 (as Mutated Fruit), and Fallout 3 and
    Fallout New Vegas (as Mutfruit and Crunchy Mutfruit). So in these older
    titles, where does the fruit come from?

    The trees are made from scratch, but are inspired by their appearance in
    Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. This makes them quite lore-friendly.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPMutfruitTrees - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPMutfruitTrees - Textures.bsa” and “JXPMutfruitTrees.esp”. The mod is
       now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added trees to Wasteland, each with a universal script and three different
      ground textures, as well as a dead variant for Arefu.
      Added a levelled list to control mutfruit delivery to the player.

                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPEssentialBigTown License.txt” file to ensure you
       understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JJXPEssentialBigTown.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPEssentialBigTown.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory.
       The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPEssentialBigTown Readme.txt” and
       “JXPEssentialBigTown License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPEssentialBigTown.esp” to
       enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Makes all inhabitants of Big Town essential (unkillable), with some
    caveats. This includes Sticky, even if he's still in Little Lamplight.

    Shorty only becomes essential after you rescue him from the Germantown
    Police Headquarters Basement; that way the Rescue Shorty objective isn't
    broken.

    The Protectron and Sentry Bot become essential if you chose to repair them
    after Big Trouble in Big Town.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    I have no rationale. I'm a big squish and don't want the kids at Big Town
    to die.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPEssentialBigTown.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added "essential" flag via script injection to all Big Towners, and on
      Shorty and the robots when certain conditions are met.

                                  7. CREDITS

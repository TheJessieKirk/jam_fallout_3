                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPFortConstantineCC Licenses.txt” file to ensure you

       “JXPFortConstantineCC.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPFortConstantineCC.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The
       usual locations of this directory are:

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPFortConstantineCC Readme.txt” and
       “JXPFortConstantineCC Licenses.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPFortConstantineCC.esp” to enable it,
       then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Adds a new Ghoulish area to Fort Constantine with cut content, mummifies
    Tara Field's corpse and makes doors auto-lock to explain why the keys are
    still needed.

    The keys and doors are re-organised, and the new area houses Crowley's cut
    content terminal entries, and reveals more of his backstory.

    NOTE: This mod used to be called Fort Constantine Tara Fields Corpse Mod.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    It's explained during You Gotta Shoot 'Em In The Head that the mercenary
    team had difficulty with Ghouls, yet there are no Ghouls at the fort. While
    adding a Ghoulish area, I couldn't resist adding Crowley's cut content,
    with a suitable explanation as to why he was trapped there for so long.

    Tara Fields' corpse wouldn't look fresh after so many years; instead it
    should be mummified by the dry, critter-free environment.

    Also, the keys are apparently still required, seeing as returning to the
    Fort without all of them isn't an option for Crowley. It seems unlikely
    that the mercenary team would have locked all the doors behing them, so now
    the doors electronically shut by themselves.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPFortConstantineCC - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPFortConstantineCC - Sounds.bsa”,
       “JXPFortConstantineCC - Textures.bsa” and
       “JXPFortConstantineCC.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

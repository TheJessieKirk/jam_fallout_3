    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPThePittFixes Readme.txt” and
       “JXPThePittFixes Licenses.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to
       retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPThePittFixes.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Makes Trogs fear floodlights, improves Pitt Slave post-rebellion dialogue,
    fixes clipping issues, Uptown floodlight control, non-interactive
    containers and lots of other things.

    Trogs will now behave canonically when entering a spot illuminated with
    floodlights; they will flee. This will happen in the Abandoned Area and the
    Steel Yard. They also can't enter areas that are very brightly lit with
    floodlights at all (the Mill, Uptown and Wernher's Hideout). At least,
    they can't enter Uptown so long as the power is still on.

    The game never explains that Trogs fear bright lights (which they didn't
    anyway) until Wernher possibly gives you the option to shut off Uptown's
    lights in Free Labor. Graffiti has been added to explain this to the player
    early.

    If the player chooses to shut off Uptown's floodlights, ALL the floodlights
    in Uptown now shut off correctly, including the ones on and in Haven.

    Trogs now level up with the player correctly when they go past level 20,
    with the Trog Brutalizer, Berzerker and Destroyer.

    Post-rebellion Pitt Slave AI and dialogue has been fixed; they will no
    longer discuss rebellion when they already have done it, they won't
    continue to slave away, and if freed, they won't speak to the player as if
    they haven't.

    Adan no longer gets killed for no reason off-screen, Adan and Millie join
    in with the uprising and Brand now gets murdered by the other Pitt Slaves.

    Flickering/clipping objects have been fixed: the large flight of stairs no
    longer has two walls existing in the same space and time, and scaffolding
    and alleyway rubble flickering has been fixed by seamlessly covering them
    up.

    Accessible, but non-interactive containers and furniture have been made
    interactive in the Abandoned Apartments, Ashur's Palace, Downtown, Midea's
    Quarters, the Mill, Updown and the Pitt bridge area.

    Ownership has been fixed: ownership in Downtown, the Mill and Uptown is no
    longer random and sporadic, Friday and Harris now own their own shops,
    Ashur and Sandra now own the things in their Palace and Wernher now owns
    his Hideout; he won't allow you to steal from him anymore, but he doesn't
    mind if you sleep there.

    Trogs no longer drop items they shouldn't have access to: Metro Tickets and
    meat items from animals that don't live in The Pitt.

    Some floating objects have been repositioned in the Abandoned Apartments.

    Ashur is now Evil instead of Neutral.

    A non-visible, non-reachable locker has been removed from the Mill.

    The Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch changed Everett to a non-mutated
    human. He's now a mutant again. Also, the Patch made the small generators
    make their looping noise twice, and continue to run if the player chooses
    to shut the power off; this has been fixed. You don't need the Patch to use
    this mod, however.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The Trogs being afraid of bright lights is very I Am Legend and it really
    sucked that the Trogs didn't actually do it.

    The other fixes are just tidying up and finishing what was already there.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPThePittFixes.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added triggers, markers, scripts and packages to make Trogs flee from
      floodlight areas.
      Added scripts to doors that could potentially allow Trogs through when
      chasing a target to prevent them activating the doors.
      Finished daisy-chaining floodlight markers in Uptown and added shut-off
      enable parents to floodlights that never had any.
      Replaced all non-interactive, reachable static containers with actual
      containers.
      Removed a non-visible, non-interactive locker from the Mill.
      Repositioned three Garden Gnomes in the Abandoned Apartments.
      Removed clipping meshes from Market Square Kit stairs.

      Added three stronger Trog types and added them to levelled creatures.
      Added overrides to stop Pitt Slaves talking to each other post rebellion.
      Added a script to swap out or disable Pitt Slaves with too many packages
      to untangle, with new AI packages for swapees.
      Made the Ashur Family faction and Ashur Evil.
      Added a global variable that tracks how Free Labor was completed for
      future updates.
      Added new Trog loot lists.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Places cut Vault 87, 92 and 106 Jumpsuits in dressers, normalises Jumpsuits
    and fixes dresser placement.

    All normal (non-utility, non-scientist) Jumpsuits are now the same in value
    as the Vault 101 Jumpsuit, at 8 caps.

    Non-interactive dressers in Vault 92 and 106 have been replaced with
    containers, containing the same randomised Jumpsuits as the Vault 101
    dressers do. Two dressers have been placed in the Vault 87 Living
    Quarters.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Cut content is fun content, plus they're perfectly lore-friendly. It also
    seems sensible that Vault Jumpsuits are valued the same, as they are almost
    identicle.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPVaultJumpsuitsCutContentAndFixes.esp”. The mod is
       now uninstalled.

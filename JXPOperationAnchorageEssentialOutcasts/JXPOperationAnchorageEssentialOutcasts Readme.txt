                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    2. Extract the file “JXPOperationAnchorageEssentialOutcasts.esp” from the
       archive file “JXPOperationAnchorageEssentialOutcasts.zip” to your PC's
       Fallout 3 Data directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPOperationAnchorageEssentialOutcasts
       Readme.txt” and “JXPOperationAnchorageEssentialOutcasts License.txt” to
       your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to
       “JXPOperationAnchorageEssentialOutcasts.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Makes all the Outcasts stationed at Bailey's Crossroads essential
    (unkillable), with some caveats.

    The future-rebelious Outcasts are essential to begin with, but lose their
    immortality when they turn on Protector McGraw and Specialist Olin.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    I have no rationale. I'm a big squish and don't want the Outcasts to die.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPOperationAnchorageEssentialOutcasts.esp”. The mod
    is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added "essential" flag via script injection to all Outcasts at Bailey's
      Crossroads; a script that removes it when the Outcasts turn on each
      other.

    1.0.0
      Made 100% compatible with my Operation Anchorage Bailey's Crossroads Cut
      Content and Fixes mod.

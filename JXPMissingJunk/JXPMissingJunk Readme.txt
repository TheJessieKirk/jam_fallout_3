                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

       your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXPMissingJunk - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPMissingJunk - Textures.bsa” and “JXPMissingJunk.esp” from the
       archive file “JXPMissingJunk.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory.
       The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPMissingJunk - Readme.txt” and
       “JXPMissingJunk - License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPMissingJunk.esp” to enable it, then
       click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds the Yellow Pass Card from Fallout and Fallout 2 to the game.

    NPCs that spawn with a random Blue Pass Card or Red Pass Card have an equal
    chance of having a Yellow Pass Card.

    Like the Blue Pass Card and Red Pass Card, the Yellow Pass Card doesn't
    appear anywhere in the world and is useless; it will only appear as a
    random item.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The Blue Pass Card, Red Pass Card and Yellow Pass Card appeared in Fallout
    (as the Blue pass key, Red pass key and Yellow pass key), and the Red Pass
    Card and Yellow Pass Card in Fallout 2 (as the Red reactor keycard and
    Yellow reactor keycard).

    Since it's perfectly lore-friendly, and just as useless as the other keys,
    why not have the complete set?

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPMissingJunk - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPMissingJunk - Textures.bsa”and “JXPMissingJunk.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

    NOTE: Any Yellow Pass Cards you have in your player character's inventory,
          have placed in any containers or placed in the world will disappear
          if this mod is uninstalled. If you reinstall this mod in the future,
          they won't reappear.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

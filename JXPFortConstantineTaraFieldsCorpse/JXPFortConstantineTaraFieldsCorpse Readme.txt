    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select Data Files.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPFortConstantineTaraFieldsCorpse.esp”
       to enable it, then click/tap the OK button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod replaces Tara Field's recently deceased corpse with a skeleton.

    Tara Field's 10mm ammunition and key are now in a Metal Box next to her
    remains to ensure they are not blown away by explosives, or similar.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Tara Fields has been dead for a number of years, but her remains look like
    she died very recently. While her remains probably wouldn't be skeletonised
    due to the environment, I feel it's a better choice than a normal body
    (rather like Grady's remains in Marigold Metro Station).

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPFortConstantineTaraFieldsCorpse.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPTheChopShopCutContentAndFixes Licenses.txt” file to
       ensure you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the files “JXPTheChopShopCutContentAndFixes.esp” from the
       archive file “JXPTheChopShopCutContentAndFixes.zip” to your PC's Fallout
       3 Data directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files
       “JXPTheChopShopCutContentAndFixes Readme.txt” and
       “JXPTheChopShopCutContentAndFixes Licenses.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3
       Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPTheChopShopCutContentAndFixes.esp” to
       enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Adds detail to The Chop Shop back area, properly restores access to that
    area and cut terminal entries.

    While the Updated Unofficial Patch does this, there's lingering mistakes
    with the cut terminal entries and the back area remains unfinished.

    The back area is now more detailed with clutter, has lighting, an
    "air-lock" type door arrangement, and the Glowing Ones Ethyl and Meat now
    become aggressive when the player goes back there.

    The terminal entry names are abbreviated to simply "Entry 01" to "Entry 3"
    as the original, longer names were truncated by the Terminal screen.

    Fixed some bad writing and grammatical mistakes in the Terminal entries and
    restored them to the Terminal.

    You don't need the Updated Unofficial Patch to use this mod.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    It does appear that the back area to The Chop Shop was intended to be
    accessible as there is a safe back there (Doctor Barrows probably used
    Ethyl and Meat as guards as well as test-subjects), and the Glowing Ones
    have names which the player can't discover normally, and Doctor Barrow's
    terminal is accessible but does nothing when actually accessed.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPTheChopShopCutContentAndFixes.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Finished back area.
      Corrected cut terminal entries and fixed terminal problems.
      Made Ethyl and Meat Foolhardy instead of cowardly and scripted them to
      attack the player when the back area "air-lock" is opened up.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod "cleans" the Jefferson Memorial water sources post-Take It Back!,
    merges the two seperate versions of the Museum and Gift Shop and Rotunda,
    allows the player to continue to access the Taft Tunnel and Memorial
    Sub-Basement, and fixes numerous other things.

    Broken Steel added seperate cells for post-Take It Back!'s Jefferson
    Memorial Museum and Gift Shop and Rotunda, and blocked off access to the
    Taft Tunnel and Memorial Sub-Basement. They are now merged, meaning
    player changes to the area are kept (like leaving things there), and
    access to the cut-off Sub-Basement and Taft Tunnel is restored.

    The water available from the urinals, sinks and toilets inside the
    Jefferson Memorial Museum and Gift Shop is now the same as the Tidal
    Basin, and the water in the toilet bowl is now clean.

    Access to the Pump Control is still not possible post-Take It Back!, as
    it's full of water. Plus, it's now *actually* full of flowing water, which
    can be viewed from both the old entrance in the Museum and Gift Shop and
    exit in the Sub-Basement.

    Almost all of the stuff added post-Take It Back! to the Memorial
    Sub-Basement and Rotunda is still added, and almost all stuff that was
    removed is still removed.

    A lot of clutter was added to barricade the former-Pump Control area and
    Memorial Sub-Basement door; this stuff was cleared.

    During the merge, some furniture and the like was found to be *very* close
    to their post-Take It Back! counterparts; they've simply been removed.

    The turret is now deactivated when first entering the Museum and Gift Shop.
    It's programmed to not attack the members of the Project Purity team.
    It can be reprogrammed, reactivated, etc.

    The Enclave will still restore and re-program the turret during The Waters
    of Life, but now the Brotherhood of Steel will as well after Take It Back!,
    rather than just removing it.

    Some things from the pre-Take It Back! version of Memorial areas that were
    removed post-Take It back! are just kept where there was no logical reason
    to remove them (and vise versa for items only added post-Take It Back!),
    such as emergency lights, wiring looms, etc.

    Non-interactive containers (desks and such), where the drawers are
    feasibly accessible, are now accessible.

    Post-Take It Back! radio sets are now tuned to GNR rather than Enclave
    Radio for obvious reasons.

    The stacks of sledgehammers and lead pipes have been changed to singles,
    and all weapons have modest health rather than 100%.

    TODO What junk stays and goes
    TODO Turret
    TODO Container inventory management

                                 4. RATIONALE

    I assume the water for the Jefferson Memorial is ultimately fed from the
    Tidal Basin; if not, with all the plumbing work done by the team at the
    site, I just found it strange that they wouldn't have connected the
    interior water sources to the Basin or the Project Purity machinery itself.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPBrokenSteelProjectPurityFixes.bsa” and
       “JXPBrokenSteelProjectPurityFixes.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

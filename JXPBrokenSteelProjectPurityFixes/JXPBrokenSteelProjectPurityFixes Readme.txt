       directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files
       “JXPBrokenSteelProjectPurityFixes Readme.txt” and
       “JXPBrokenSteelProjectPurityFixes License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3
       Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPBrokenSteelProjectPurityFixes.esp” to
       enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod "cleans" (post-Take It Back) Project Purity's drinking sources and
    fixes the multiplied sledgehammers.

    The water available from the urinals, sinks and toilets inside the
    Jefferson Memorial Museum and Gift Shop is now the same as the Tidal
    Basin; whether clean or infected with Eden's FEV.

    The stack of 17 sledgehammers on the floor has been changed to a single
    example.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    I assume the water for the Jefferson Memorial is ultimately fed from the
    Tidal Basin; if not, with all the plumbing work done by the team at the
    site, I just found it strange that they wouldn't have connected the
    interior water sources to the Basin or the Project Purity machinery itself.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPBrokenSteelProjectPurityFixes.bsa” and
       “JXPBrokenSteelProjectPurityFixes.esp”. The mod is now uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

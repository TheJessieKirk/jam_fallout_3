                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds eyebots and empty lockers to all of Raven Rock's holding
    cells.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    In Raven Rock - Level 3, there doesn't seem to be anything special about
    the Lone Wanderer's holding cell; yet it's the only one of the 6 jails with
    wall-mounted eyebots, and the only one with a locker.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPRavenRockHoldingCells.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added 10 new eyebots and 5 empty Enclave lockers to all Raven Rock -
      Level 3 holding cells.

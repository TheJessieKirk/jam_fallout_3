                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Restores a cut Outcast, improves Outcast AI in the area, allows access to
    the upper areas of the Super Mutant building, adds details to upper areas,
    adds Super Mutant detailing, makes leaky pipes radioactive and fixes
    numerous other things.

    Previously, the upper area of the Super Mutant occupied building in
    Bailey's Crossroads was inaccessible, making some Super Mutants impossible
    to loot: players can now just cross some planks and go up there.

    The area was not designed for a player to explore, so extensive work has
    been done to finish the building and add detail to the upper area.

    Despite being a Super Mutant camp, the building lacked any Super Mutant
    details, such as spikes and gore bags: these have now been added.

    The leaky pipes in Bailey's Crossroads are now slightly radioactive, as is
    the norm for Wasteland water.

    The Outcasts can be tricked into thinking you're one of them; these
    dialogue options have been fixed so Outcasts won't think you're wearing
    their Power Armor when you aren't, but won't forget that you've tricked
    them if you aren't either.

    The Outcast AI has been tweaked to improve Outcast movement through the
    ruins.

    Defender Morrill's initial greeting has been fixed so it always happens. He
    is also essential (unkillable), as this fixes a lot of broken dialogue the
    other Outcasts make.

    A cut Outcast has been restored. She now joins the initial assault on the
    ruins.

    The Outcasts equipment/stats has been redesigned so they behave/are
    equipped like the regular ingame Outcasts are, and level up with the
    player.

    Bailey's Crossroads lighting, ambience and music now matches other urban
    areas in DC.

    Rubble pile placement has been fixed so there are no clipping issues or
    buildings that appear incomplete.

    Outcasts that previously wore no helmets are wearing cut Outcast Recon
    Helmets instead.

    The loot inside the sealed armoury can no longer be picked up by NPCs; only
    the player can loot them.

    NOTE: This mod used to be called Jessie's Operation Anchorage Bailey's
    Crossroads Fixes.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    The Bailey's Crossroads area is great, but seemed unpolished here and
    there. I hope this is a faithful attempt to finish it.

    Super Mutants almost always add their spikes and gore bags to areas they
    occupy and seem to be able to erect such structures fairly quickly given
    how close many of their camps are to areas occupied by other factions.
    Plus, we don't know how long the Outcasts were under attack for.

    Inaccessible areas are fine, but not being able to loot enemies due to them
    being placed in them is really frustrating; some Super Mutants carry quite
    valuable weapons, and it's also not really fair to players that prefere
    close combat.

    Leaky pipes and water sources in the Wasteland are usually radioactive,
    such as the leaks in the Mirelurk Nesting Hole.

    The Outcasts dialogue where the player can trick them was bugged, and the
    Updated Unofficial Patche's well-meaning attempts to fix it made it worse.
    All dialogue should now make sense.

    Normalising Bailey's Crossroads ambience, music and lighting makes it feel
    a lot more like part of DC.

    Recon helmets are commonly worn by Power Armored people that aren't wearing
    Power Helmets. Even Ashur wears one.

    During the conflict between the Outcasts, NPCs can sometimes pick up
    weapons from the armoury, sometimes helping themselves to unique weapons.
    This seems like an oversight.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPOperationAnchorageBaileysCrossroadsFixes.esp”. The
       mod is now uninstalled.

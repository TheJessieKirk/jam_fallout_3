    5. If you use Broken Steel, extract the file
       “JXPMapMarkersBrokenSteelCP.esp” from the archive file
       “JXPMapMarkers.zip” to the same location as above. Otherwise, do not
       extract this file.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod adds map markers to the Capital Wasteland, meaning there are no
    unmarked markers.

    Rockopolis is a special exception: the location is not revealed on the
    Pip-Boy map unless the player first enters it. The player can then fast
    travel to it as often as they wish.

    For The Pitt expansion, this mod adds a single map marker, and prevents the
    Radio Tower map marker from disapearing after the player meets with
    Wernher.

    For Point Lookout, this mod adds many additional map markers.

    For Broken Steel, this mod adds a single map marker.

    If you DON'T use Mothership Zeta, this mod adds a map marker for the Alien
    Crash Site.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    It's established by ingame dialogue that locations can be punched in to the
    Pip-Boy, thus it seems strange that the player doesn't do that when they
    find a noteworthy location.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPMapMarkers.esm”, as well as any additional
       JXPMapMarker CP esp files you extracted above The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Added map markers and DLC compatibility patches.

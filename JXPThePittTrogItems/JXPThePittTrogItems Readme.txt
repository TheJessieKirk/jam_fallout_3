                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPThePittTrogItems License.txt” file to ensure you
       understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPThePittTrogItems.esm” from the archive file
       “JXPThePittTrogItems.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory. The
       usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPThePittTrogItemsTheTTickets.esp”,
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsTheTTickets - Meshes.bsa” and
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsTheTTickets - Textures.bsa” to your PC's Fallout 3
       Data directory (see GAMES CHANGES for a description).

    3. If you use Jessie's Missing Junk Mod (JXPMissingJunk), extract the
       files “JXPThePittTrogItemsMissingJunkCP.esp”,
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsMissingJunkCP - Meshes.bsa” and
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsMissingJunkCP - Textures.bsa” to your PC's Fallout 3
       Data directory so that the mods work together correctly.

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPThePittTrogItems Readme.txt” and
       “JXPThePittTrogItems License.txt” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data directory
       to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPThePittTrogItems.esm” to enable it,
       as well as “JXPThePittTrogItemsMissingJunkCP.esp” and/or
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsTheTTickets.esp” if you chose to use them, then
       click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    This mod removes Metro Tickets from the random items dropped by dead trogs.

    Optionally, this mod also adds "The T" (Pittsburgh subway) tickets to trogs
    instead.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    In the real world, Pittsburg has a subway railway in Downtown which has
    been there since well before the Fallout universe diverged from our
    own. It makes sense that the Pitt's Downtown may still retain access to it,
    but it's not a “metro” system.

    In game terms, Trogs sometimes drop Metro Tickets simply because they use
    the same levelled list as Ghouls.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the files “JXPThePittTrogItems.esm”,
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsTheTTickets.esp”,
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsTheTTickets - Meshes.bsa”,
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsTheTTickets - Textures.bsa”,
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsMissingJunkCP.esp”,
       “JXPThePittTrogItemsMissingJunkCP - Meshes.bsa” and
       “JJXPThePittTrogItemsMissingJunkCP - Textures.bsa”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Created new dropped-on-death levelled item list for Trogs identical to
      the Ghoul's list, except lacking Metro Tickets and Pass Cards.

    0.2.0
      Restored Pass Cards, as they are a callback to classic Fallout games,
      rather than a card used to access Washington DC's metro lines.
      Fixed Readme spelling mistakes.

    1.0.0
      Updated file naming to new conventions.

    2.0.0
      Added optional "The T" Tickets.
      Converted to master file for better mod compatibility.

    2.0.1
      Fixed syntax errors in documentation.

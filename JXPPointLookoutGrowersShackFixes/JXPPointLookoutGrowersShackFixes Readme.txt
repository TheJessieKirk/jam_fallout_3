                         2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Review the “JXPPointLookoutGrowersShackFixes License.txt” file to ensure
       you understand your rights.

    2. Extract the file “JXPPointLookoutGrowersShackFixes.esp” from the archive
       file “JXPPointLookoutGrowersShackFixes.zip” to your PC's Fallout 3 Data
       directory. The usual locations of this directory are:

           Steam Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Steam Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Data

           Retail Version, 64-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

           Retail Version, 32-bit Windows:
             C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data

    3. Optionally, extract the files “JXPPointLookoutGrowersShackFixes
       Readme.txt” and “JXPPointLookoutGrowersShackFixes License.txt” to your
       PC's Fallout 3 Data directory to retain them for future reference.

    4. Launch Fallout 3. When the Launcher window appears, select “Data Files”.
       The Fallout 3 Data Files window will appear containing a list of files.
       Click/tap the checkbox next to “JXPPointLookoutGrowersShackFixes.esp”
       to enable it, then click/tap the “OK” button. The mod is now installed.

                                3. GAME CHANGES

    Fixes non-interactive containers in the Run-down Shack.

    Two non-interactive desks are now interactive.

                                 4. RATIONALE

    Containers that are inexplicably inaccessible make no sense; a container
    that's fallen over, blocking the drawers/doors etc, buried in rubble, etc.
    is fine, but just sitting there normally is just silly.

                        5. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Delete the file “JXPPointLookoutGrowersShackFixes.esp”. The mod is now
       uninstalled.

                                 6. CHANGELOG

    0.1.0
      Initial commit.
      Replaced two accessible static containers with actual containers.
